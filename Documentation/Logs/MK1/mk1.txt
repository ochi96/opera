Model:.1
Data: bare mfccs, not normalised,
Architecture: 128, 128, 128, 128; l2 regularizers(0.002, 0.03, 0.03, 0.002); DropOut(0.02). 
Results: 61% validation, 77% training
Conclusion/Recommendations: Overfitting, check problematic samples.


Model : .2
Data: Arrays with k-fold validation
Architecture: Similar architecture to .1
Results: 78% validation, 85-90% training

Model : .3
Data: removed soprano soubrette and soprano spinto
Architecture: 128, 256, 256, 128; l2 regularizers(0.0

model: .4
data: male only, standardised, shuffled
architecture: 128, 80, 80; dropout: 0.4, regularizers l2; 0.09
results = 70% validation(k-fold), 83-85% highest training
recommendation: more data.

Hi Christos. 

I hope you are well. Here is the current update regarding the project.

I believe we are quite close to the end of the development phase and report writing. I have developed models that decently predict the subregister of a given audio file. I have also developed a systemized development pipeline that makes future work easier.

So far we have 4 models; two models for each gender type considered. They are trained on subsets of the dataset collected. As an example, males set A consists of 'tenor_lyric', 'bass_dramatic', 'baritone_dramatic' and 'tenor_dramatic' while males set B consists of 'bass_cantante', 'tenor_leggero', 'baritone_lyric' and 'baritone_bassbaritones'. This leaves out 'tenor spinto' out of either set because if included, it will make either model worse. The data samples are as follows:
Name                        Amount
baritone_bassbaritones :    360
baritone_dramatic :         452
baritone_lyric :            462
bass_cantante :             382
bass_dramatic :             382
tenor_dramatic :            472
tenor_leggero :             455
tenor_lyric :               458
tenor_spinto :              466

The metrics for thse males models are decent and quite frankly impressive.I have posted the results on the overleaf. We would need more than 1000 samples for each category to put this into production in my opinion. 

The females models are implemented in a similar manner. The first initial set comprised 'mezzosoprano dramatic', 'countertenor', 'contraltos'and 'mezzosoprano lyric'. This set provides decent results with a few caveats I'll explain shortly. The other dataset consists of 'soprano lyric', 'soprano dramatic',  'soprano coloratura', 'soprano soubrette', 'soprano spinto' and 'mezzosoprano coloratura'. The females data samples are as follows:
Name                        Amount
contraltos :                310
countertenor :              363
mezzosoprano coloratura :   181
mezzosoprano dramatic :     309
mezzosoprano lyric :        222
soprano spinto :            222
soprano coloratura :        178
soprano dramatic :          234
soprano lyric :             263
soprano soubrette :         295

The data available for female samples is simply not enough. This partly explains why the models are performing poorly. I believe these are our options:
1. Combine all flavours of sopranos into one category. This will lead to sopranos having a total of 1192 samples, which is a lot more than the others, leading to an unbalanced dataset. We will then have to increase the other categories' numbers to 450-500.
2. Drop sopranos altogether and increase the samples of the rest in order to create just one model for females, rather than two.

I strongly suggest that we proceed with option 1. The sopranos are quite difficult to tell apart, especially with 5 sub-registers. Combining them will help create better distinctions from the other categories. It is also no wonder that a category such as 'mezzosoprano coloratura' performs poorly as it has only 180 samples. 

Either way, we have to increase these numbers to at least match the males dataset. This is the remaining stumbling block to the project.
I wanted to run this by you because as you may recall, collecting these initial samples took a non-trivial amount of time. We need averagely 200 samples more per females categories.

The results on overleaf are the latest. You may also decide to proceed with them as they are.

Thanks, 
Bramwel Omondi.

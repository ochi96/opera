Key Notes

1. Trained models; general model, male only model, female only model and variations using different methods(transfer learning, scaling/no scaling and exploring other features other than MFCCs.
2. Male only model produced a high of 70%. This is encouraging on the first try. With more data and addding more features, in addtion to Transfer Learning, I am confident the model can get to 0.85-0.9.
3. Female only model gives less than 0.5. Removing problematic classes like soprano spinro and soprano soubrette improves it to 0.6. However, I think more data in this case will only improve the model marginally. Here we'll have to add more features and custom make a model.
4. The general model is now at 0.65. 

Last week was more of reconnaissance. Trying to know that the work pipeline is ok, data is ok and establishing the baseline.

This week:

1. Focus on males, with Transfer Learning. The level of improvement will determine how much more data needs to be added.
2. Create a separate workflow for female singers. If the problem is the data, I'll explore ways of improving data quality(for example, sampling methods). More data is not the solution in all cases.
3. Design an ensemble that accepts both male and female categories. 

Target:
0.8 for males
0.7 for females

0.75 general model.
